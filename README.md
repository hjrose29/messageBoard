# messageBoard
CSC375 - Parallel Computing - Project 2

<b> What I did </b> Built a concurrent message board in two ways, one handling requests as an ArraList and the other implementing a concurrent data store!

<b>Purpose: </b> To benchmark the two data stores for throughput across multiple users assessing the practicality of each!
